# XLang - A Simple Interpreted Language for Beginners

## Project Overview

**Purpose:** XLang is designed as an educational tool to introduce beginners to coding concepts. It emphasizes simplicity, clear error explanations, and key language features to facilitate a smooth entry into programming. Confusing syntax is reduced to allow for beginners to focus on logic instead of memorizing vocabulary. 

**Target Audience:** Beginners to coding. Middle-High School Levels.

**Simplicity:** XLang reduces complexities with easy-to-read syntax, avoiding unnecessary terms, and providing clear error explanations to ease new programmers into coding.

## Language Design (Syntax & Constructs)

- **Assignment:** `IS`
- **Data Types:** `NUMBER` (INT), `DECIMAL`, `TEXT`, `LETTER`, `T/F`, `LIST`, `DICT`, `GROUP`
- **Operations:** `PRINT`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `DIV`, `MULT`, `EQUAL`, `NOT EQUAL`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `GREATER THAN`, `GREATER OR EQUAL TO`, `LESSER THAN`, `LESSER OR EQUAL TO`
- **Control Flow:** `IF`, `THEN`, `LOOPS FOR`, `LOOP WHILE`
- **I/O:** `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`
- **Functions:** `DEFINE` (def _____)

## Lexer/Tokenizer & Parser

Refer to `lexer_parser.c` for the implementation of the lexer and parser.


## Interpreter & Error Handling

Refer to `interpreter_error.c` for the implementation of the interpreter and error handling.


## How to Run Programs

Compile the following files using a C compiler:
- parser_lexer.c
- Interpreter_ErrorHandling.c
- sample_code.c


## Our Design Choices

- **Simplicity:** Prioritizing simplicity in syntax and design to enhance the learning experience.
- **Clear Error Messages:** Designed to be informative, aiding users in identifying and rectifying issues in their code.

## Testing Examples

See screenshots and code examples in the repository demonstrating the interpreter's functionality in various scenarios.

## Sample Program Code

Refer to `sample_code.c` for the implementation of the interpreter.

## Conclusion

XLang is a beginner-friendly language aiming to simplify the learning process. Explore the provided sample programs and documentation for a better understanding of the language.
